# entities used or calculating gradients on factors

export FactorGradientsCached!

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Container for calculating gradients on a factor.  See helper contructor functions.

Take graph on one function ``f`` between two variables and based on measurement ``z``
```
(:x1)-[:x1x2f1]-(:x2)
```

The gradient (a matrix operating on coordinates) is defined as ``(▽f - I)`` according to
````math
0 = (▽ f - I) dC
````

where the augmented vector of coordinates is ``dC = [dX_1, dX_2]'``.  The idea is that ``dC`` should be 
in the null space of ``(▽f - I)`` as per normal partial derivative (vector) decomposition;
````math
dX_1 = {∂f}/{∂X_2'} dX_2 + ...
````

modeled in coordinates.

Notes
- Memory is cached in the object.
- Gradients are updated as a functor call to the object, see example.
- The factor is assumed to be in "tension or compression" which manifests as `_slack` in the calculated factor residual which is also cached.

DevNotes
- TODO type stability
- TODO in-place memory operations
- TODO relax hard coordinate assumptions and instead allow direct operator definitions with the manifold tangent ``T_f M``. 

Example
```julia
# problem set
pp = LinearRelative(MvNormal([10;0],[1 0; 0 1]))
measurement = ([10.0;0.0],)
varTypes = (ContinuousEuclid{2}, ContinuousEuclid{2})
pts = ([0;0.0], [9.5;0])

# build and evaluate the functor object
grad = FactorGradientsCached!(pp, measurement, varTypes, pts);
J = grad(measurement..., pts...)

# cached value stored
J_ = grad.cached_gradients

# double check things are working
@assert norm(J_ - J) < 1e-6 
```
