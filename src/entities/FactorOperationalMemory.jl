$(TYPEDEF)

Main factor memory container used during inference operations.

Notes
- CCW does not get serialized / persisted
- At writing, the assumption is there is just one CCW per factor
- Any multithreaded design needs to happens as sub-constainers inside CCW or otherwise, to carry separate memory.
- Since #467, `CalcFactor` is the only type 'seen by user' during `getSample` or function residual calculations `(cf::CalcFactor{<:MyFactor})`, s.t. `MyFactor <: AbstractRelative___`
- There also exists a `CalcFactorMahalanobis` for parameteric computations using as much of the same mechanics as possible.
