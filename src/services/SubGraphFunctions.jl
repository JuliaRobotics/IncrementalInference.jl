Specialized subgraph function for cliques to build a deep subgraph copy from the DFG given a list of frontals and separators.
Dev notes:
- TODO Since a clique should already have a list of frontals, seperators, and potentials (factors), this function should just be a light wrapper around copyGraph or buildSubgraph
- TODO Send in clique and then extract frontals, separators and factors
- TODO ability to limit which solveKeys to copy.

    $SIGNATURES

Build a new subgraph from `fgl<:AbstractDFG` containing all variables and factors
associated with `cliq`.  Additionally add the upward message prior factors as
needed for belief propagation (inference).

Notes
- `cliqsym::Symbol` defines the cliq where variable appears as a frontal variable.
- `varsym::Symbol` defaults to the cliq frontal variable definition but can in case a
  separator variable is required instead.

DevNotes
- TODO review, are all updates atomic?? Then perhaps in-memory only can be reduced to references back to csmc.dfg.
